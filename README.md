The current scene contains a spinning triangle whose colour varies over time. You can zoom in and out of the scene by left-clicking and dragging on the window.

Plumbing includes use of a VAO, a VBO, GLFW callbacks, uniform variables, and a basic shader program for you to use as a starting point in your projects.
